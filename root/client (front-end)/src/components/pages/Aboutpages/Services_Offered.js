          A store has perfectly good food that they cannot sell, in seconds, 
          they upload a description of the food using our webapp.
          We receive a notification letting us know the food is available for collection. 
          We send one of our delivery drones to collect it.
          Itâ€™s a win-win! Our organisation and charities have access to a supply of fresh food and 
          businesses can contribute to their community in a meaningful way.
          Any individual can also contribute to sending us unused food or ingredients.

          We work with local charities and work in community and inhouse kitchens to provide food
          that is displayed on our web app for users to pick from.
          Once picked, it is delivered straight to your doorstep safe and sound. No hassle, no risk.
