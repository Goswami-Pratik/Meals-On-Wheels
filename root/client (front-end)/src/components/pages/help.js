                    <h2>For Restaurants</h2><br/>
                   <p> On the daily basis, Restaurants are forced to throw out tons of food all across the world.
                       We here at Meals on Wheels want to make a change to that - give purpose to all that food waste.
                   </p><br/>

                   <p>
                       Restaurants can now donate that excess food to people who are in need and Meals on Wheels is here for that. 
                        We want you to be able to not only help the environment but also those in need! 
                   </p><br/>

                   <p>
                    If you head over to the contact page and send us a message through the form and Meals on Wheels will be right back with you. 
                    We will help begin your community helping journey!
                   </p><br/>

                    <h2>For Customers</h2>
                    <p>
                        While our main purpose is to feed our beloved customers, nothing makes us happier than a helping hand.
                    </p><br/>

                    <p>Customers can simply help us by ordering through Meals on Wheels. This simply plays a huge role in preventing food waste which in turn prevents trashing our environment.
                        You can also choose to make two types of donations - Ingredients and Monetary.
                        Ingredients can be stored and delivered for when a household in need asks for it. 
                    </p><br/>

                    <p>
                        Customers can also donate to Meals on Wheels directly through the Help page which contains a Donation form.
                        All Donation proceeds to help us better Meals on Wheels which in turn helps us better our community. 
                        Donations can be used to help increase our delivery output so as to feed more people. It can also help us implement more eco-friendly options to safely deliver.
